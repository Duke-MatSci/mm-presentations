        <!--Case Studies-->
        <h1>Case Studies in Polymer Nanocomposites and Metamaterials</h1>
        <p>
            The following case studies demonstrate knowledge creation through both <strong>big</strong> data (simulation data of mechanical metamaterials)
            and <em>broad</em> data (experimental data of polymer nanocomposites).</p>
        <br>
        <h2>NanoMine Case Study</h2>

        <br>
        <p>
            In mechanical analysis, the <em>tan &delta;</em> peak is known to decrease as a function of increasing filler content.
            However, upon aggregating the tan &delta; peak from many datasets, any downward trend was negated by variability in the
            underlying data. By including quantitative descriptors that describe how well the nanoparticle fillers are dispersed within the matrix,
            the underlying trends were unveiled. These results point to the importance of quantitative descriptors derived from image data.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>MetaMine Case Study</h2>

        <img src="./images/MMcasestudy.png">
        <br>
        <p>
            Using modern computational tools to develop structure-property models for mechanical metamaterials can accelerate the development of these materials.
            Mechanical behavior of metamaterials&mdash;determined by their constituent materials as well as their intricate structure&mdash;are difficult to predict
            without performing computationally expensive simulations. By feeding large datasets of 2-D and 3-D metamaterials and their simulated property information, 
            machine learning methods reveal relationships between the geometric facets of the structure and the properties of the metamaterial.

        <!--Data Curation-->
        <h1><a name="curation">Data Curation</a></h1>
        <p>
            In order to apply data-driven tools, data must be <em>curated</em> into the system in structured, machine-readable formats.
        </p>
        <p>
            Curation of semi-structured data from a variety of sources (e.g., publications, datasets provided by researchers) into a structured format
            involves assigning the appropriate labels as metadata to the individual datasets. These labels are defined within a <em>schema</em>.            
        </p>
        <p>
            To map datasets into the schema, configurable MS Excel templates have been created. These enable researchers to curate their own data into
            the system. A set of scripts parse the Excel templates, perform data validation checks, and map the data into XML files.
        </p>

        <!--Materials Knowledge Graph-->
        <h1><a name="knowledgegraph">Materials Knowledge Graph</a></h1>
        <p>
            A <em>knowledge graph</em> is a collection of node&mdash;and edges describing the relationships between nodes&mdash;that together create a formal
            representation of knowledge within a domain.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/ontology.png">
        <br>
        <p>
            MaterialsMine data is ultimately stored as a knowledge graph. The underlying structure of the knowledge graph is defined by an <em>ontology</em>.
            Initially built as an ontology for polymer nanocomposites, the ontology is currently being extended to mechanical metamaterials.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the knowledge graph, nodes and edges have unique identifiers (URIs), making all relationships unambiguous and machine-readable. Information is 
            stored in RDF triples, which are more flexible than conventional data structures.
        </p>

        <h1><a name="searchviz">Search & Visualization</a></h1>
        <p>
            To view and interact with data in the knowledge graph, search and visualization tools are being developed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="./images/searchviz.png">
        <br>
        <p>
            To query data within MaterialsMine, a faceted browser enables selection of parameters of interest. Once data are pulled from the knowledge graph,
            the user can create visualizations depending on the types of data that were queried.
        </p>
        <p>
            For users familiar with RDF and the semantic web, MaterialsMine also features a <a href="https://materialsmine.org/wi/sparql.html">SPARQL endpoint</a>
            for querying the Knowledge Graph directly.

        <p>
            A suite of modular tools enable researchers to apply data-driven tools directly to their data.

        <p>
            For example, the Microstructure Characterization & Reconstruction (MCR) tool provides quantitative descriptors on microscope images (e.g. TEM) to quantify
            dispersion parameters associated with the image. These descriptors provide a basis for further analysis, and can be added as new knowledge within
            the knowledge graph.
        </p>

        <!--Data Storage-->
        <h1><a name="storage">Data Storage</a></h1>
        <p>
            After being curated into XML files, data are stored in MongoDB. Conversion scripts map those XML data into RDF format for storage within the
            knowledge graph.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the schema is updated with new terms, these updates are made in the ontology as well as the RDF conversion scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ongoing work aims to streamline the process of adding new terminology to the ontology. Keeping in line with the Open World Assumption of the
            semantic web, the schema and ontology should remain agile and flexible in accepting new terms as new knowledge and knowledge representations
            are created.
